# MemBot
> An Android app built with Kotlin that includes several minigames which all aim to improve a user's memory.

MemBot was a group project that spanned the length of my last two semesters at Seneca College. Unfortunately, I was not able to fork the original repository the way I had wanted as it is private. So instead I have uploaded the apk, source code, work breakdown structure, and user manuals (including how to get the app running on your device).

## Note:

In the ***assets*** folder you will find all of the unique digital assets I created for this project, including the app icon! Though this is by far not my biggest contribution to the project, it is one of my personal favourites.
